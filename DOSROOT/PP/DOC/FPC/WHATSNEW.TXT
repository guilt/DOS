                                Version 3.0.0

******************************************************************************
                              What's New in 3.0.0
******************************************************************************

Free Pascal 3.0.0 is a new major release providing support for new
architectures and targets and also many new features and compatibility fixes.

Please also see http://wiki.freepascal.org/User_Changes_3.0.0 for a list
of changes that may affect the behaviour of previously working code, and
how to cope with these changes.

Some highlights are:

Platforms:
  * New processor architecture: MIPS (big and little endian variants)
  * New processor architecture: i8086 (primarily focusing legacy MS-DOS)
  * New "processor" architecture: JVM
  * Revived support for Motorola 68k processors (previously available
    in 1.0.x series)
  * Considerably extended supported range of ARM processor variants
  * New platform: AIX/PowerPC
  * New platform: AIX/PowerPC64
  * New platform: Android/ARM
  * New platform: Android/i386
  * New platform: Android/JVM
  * New platform: Android/MIPSEL
  * New platform: AROS/i386
  * New platform: DragonFly/x86_64
  * New platform: Java/JVM
  * New platform: Linux/MIPS
  * New platform: Linux/MIPSEL
  * New platform: msdos/i8086

Compiler:
  * New support for codepage-aware strings (bringing improved compatibility
    to recent Delphi versions)
  * Support for processor sub-architectures (mostly for ARM variants)
  * Support for multiple memory models (i8086 - including memory models
    not supported with the last TP/BP compilers)

RTL:
  * Partial support for codepage-aware strings and Unicode in the RTL
    including transparent character set conversion
  * OS/2 RTL finally provides full support for UnicodeString handling
    when running under OS/2 versions including such support (OS/2 Warp 4
    and up)
  * Direct support for certain OS/2 API functions only available in later
    OS/2 versions while allowing the created binaries to run also on older
    versions

Packages:
  * Big improvements of fpmake (fpmkunit) - all packages and utilities
    (actually everything except the compiler and RTL) are now built using
    fpmake which somewhat decreases dependency on external utilities.
  * New packages rtl-* containing units previously included in RTL; this
    allowed streamlining the RTL and thus speeding up RTL building.
  * New package fpwidestring - native implementation of Unicode string
    handling routines. This allows full support of UnicodeString also
    on targets not supporting Unicode natively or possibly on targets
    requiring linking to libc for such support.

bugs which have been fixed in this release.
