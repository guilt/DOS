-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SVGA.H    : Deals with Lowest Level Of Graphics ,Initialisation etc .
     VGA.H    : Deals with Some Basic Functions such as putpixel() .
  MATH3D.H    : Contains the Basic Data Structures and the Code to Deal with
		their rotation etc .Here is Where Splitting between BGI
		and 3DLIB takes Place .use #define IBGI before your Program
		to use BGI .
   MATHD.H    : Contains Some Algorithms to draw 3D Lines and Points and
		Meshed Objects etc .Here ,you can alter the Basic Rendering
		Engine !
 SVGA256.H    : Contains Hi-Res SVGA Drivers .
    DEFS.H    : Used for Graphics Initialisation .Overall Coverage of 3D
		Functions .
     BMP.H    : For Differentiation .Surface Programming is highly Encouraged .
     TEX.H    : Here ,care is taken to be checked that BMP.H has not been
		included .
    ZBUF.H    : Contains the Important Z-Buffering Algorithm .
    TRIL.H    : Basic Triangle Rendering Program .Adapted From the 3D
		    Black Hole .
  MATHTD.H    : Contains Routines To Draw Textured Objects .Some Routines
		must be Changed .
   24PIX.H    : Rather ,a 18PIX.H File .Allows one to Run-Time 
                Reduce a Huge Palette (24-Bit) into a 8-Bit one ,
                and is pretty useful for getting lots of Graphic Effects .
   FONTS.H    : A sample 8x8 System Font Draw able Bitmap .
   IMAGE.H    : Used to draw the easy Images themselves .Use for  
                Side-Scrollers .
  IMAWRI.H    : Used for converting 8-Bpp BMPs into easy Images .

Use these Macros to change the way things are drawn :

ISVGA         : Use the Hi-Res Full Library; Requires BGI
IBGI          : Use The Full Functionality of the BGI

I24BIT        : Use the Palette Reduction technology for the Extended Hierarchy .
                Requires non BGI graphics;

IISO          : Use a Isometric Engine for Rendering
IZCLIP        : Use Z-Clipping 
IHSR          : Include Hidden Surface Removal
IZBUF         : Use Z-Buffer ;Requires HSR ,non BGI graphics
 
Before including the any of Header Files ,define these Macros by using the #define
pre-processor to use them .
