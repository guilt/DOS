PC and PS/2 Video Modes
32   Fastgraph User's Guide

Overview

     In the PC and PS/2 worlds, the method by which information appears on
the computer's display screen is determined by the video mode currently in
effect.  The video modes have different resolutions, different character or
pixel attributes, different video memory structures, and other inherent
hardware differences.  However, you do not need an in-depth knowledge of
these video internals, because Fastgraph handles the necessary details.

     The PC and PS/2 video modes may be separated into two major classes:
text modes and graphics modes.  In text modes, the display screen is divided
into character cells.  By default, there are 25 rows and either 40 or 80
columns of cells, and in each cell we can store any of the 256 characters in
the IBM PC character set.  Each character has an associated attribute that
determines such things as its foreground color, its background color, and
whether or not the character blinks.  In graphics modes, the display screen
is divided into picture elements, or pixels.  Depending on the video mode,
the number of pixel rows ranges between 200 and 768, while the number of
columns ranges between 320 and 1,024.  Each pixel has an associated value
that determines the color of the pixel.  The number of character cells or
pixels available is called the resolution of the screen.

     The display adapter (graphics card) and the video display (monitor)
connected to it determine the video modes available on a given system.  The
following table summarizes the characteristics of the PC and PS/2 video modes
that Fastgraph supports.

     Some notes about the format and abbreviations used in this table are in
order.  In the "type" column, "T" means a text mode and "G" means a graphics
mode.  A single value in the "number of colors" column refers to the number
of colors available in that video mode.  In text modes, a pair of numbers
such as 16/8 means each displayed character can have one of 16 foreground
colors and one of 8 background colors.  In graphics modes, a pair of numbers
such as 16/64 means 16 colors can be displayed simultaneously from a
collection, or palette, of 64.  The "b/w" listed in the monochrome modes
stands for "black and white".  Characters or pixels in these video modes do
not really have associated colors but instead have display attributes such as
blinking or different intensities.

     The meanings of the abbreviations in the "supported adapters" and
"supported displays" columns are:

     CGA       Color Graphics Adapter
     ECD       Enhanced Color Display
     EGA       Enhanced Graphics Adapter
     HGC       Hercules Graphics Card
     MCGA      Multi-Color Graphics Array
     MDA       Monochrome Display Adapter
     RGB       Red-Green-Blue Color Display
     VGA       Video Graphics Array
     SVGA      SuperVGA

The use of the term "VGA" in the "supported display" column refers to any
analog display, such as a VGA or Multisync monitor.  The term "SVGA" refers
explicitly to a SuperVGA monitor or adapter.

     The IBM PS/2 family does not have an adapter and display combination per
se.  Instead, the video hardware used in these systems is called the video
subsystem.  The Model 25 and Model 30 have an MCGA-based video subsystem,
while other models have a VGA-based video subsystem.  From Fastgraph's
perspective, the PS/2 video subsystem is no different than an ordinary VGA
card and monitor.

     This rest of this chapter will provide an overview of the most important
features and restrictions of each video mode.  The first section will discuss
the text modes, while the following section will discuss the graphics modes.


Text Modes

     There are five text video modes in the IBM PC and PS/2 family.  Four of
these modes (0, 1, 2, and 3) are designed for color displays, while the
remaining mode (7) is designed for monochrome displays.  All text modes were
introduced with the original IBM PC.

     In text modes, the screen is divided into character cells.  There are
two bytes of video memory associated with each character cell -- one byte for
the character's ASCII value, and another for the character's display
attribute.  The amount of video memory required to store one screen of
information (called a video page) is thus
34   Fastgraph User's Guide

                    number_of_columns x number_of_rows x 2

All text modes use 25 rows, so for the 40-column modes (0 and 1) the size of
a video page is 2,000 bytes, and for the 80-column modes (2, 3, and 7) the
size of a video page is 4,000 bytes.

     The remainder of this section will describe the text video modes in more
detail.

Mode 0

     Mode 0 is a 40-column by 25-row color text mode.  It is often called a
colorless mode since it was designed to be used with composite or television
monitors (as opposed to RGB monitors).  When used with these types of
monitors, the available 16 "colors" appear as distinct shades of gray.  When
used with an RGB monitor, mode 0 is identical in all respects to mode 1.  The
use of composite or television monitors as PC video displays has virtually
disappeared today.  As a result, mode 0 is used infrequently.

Mode 1

     Mode 1 is a 40-column by 25-row color text mode.  It is supported across
all video adapter and color display combinations in the PC and PS/2 families.
Characters displayed in mode 1 have an associated display attribute that
defines the character's foreground color, its background color, and whether
or not it blinks.  Sixteen foreground colors and eight background colors are
available.

Mode 2

     Mode 2 is an 80-column by 25-row color text mode.  Like mode 0, it is
often called a colorless mode since it was designed to be used with composite
or television monitors (as opposed to RGB monitors).  When used with these
types of monitors, the available 16 "colors" appear as distinct shades of
gray.  When used with an RGB monitor, mode 2 is identical in all respects to
mode 3.  The use of composite or television monitors as PC video displays has
virtually disappeared today.  As a result, mode 2 is used infrequently.

Mode 3

     Mode 3 is an 80-column by 25-row color text mode.  It is the default
video mode for systems that use any type of color display.  This mode is
supported across all video adapter and color display combinations in the PC
and PS/2 families.  Characters displayed in mode 3 have an associated display
attribute that defines the character's foreground color, its background
color, and whether or not it blinks.  Sixteen foreground colors and eight
background colors are available.
                                      Chapter 2:  PC and PS/2 Video Modes   35

Mode 7

     Mode 7 is the 80-column by 25-row monochrome text mode.  It is the
default video mode for systems that use a monochrome display.  To use this
mode, you must have a Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), Hercules Graphics
Card (HGC), or an Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) connected to a monochrome
display.  Most VGA and SVGA display adapters also provide an emulation mode
that allows you to use mode 7 with analog displays.  Characters displayed in
mode 7 have an associated display attribute that defines whether the
character is invisible, normal, bold, underlined, reversed, blinking, or a
combination of these.


Graphics Modes

     There are 13 standard graphics video modes available in the IBM PC and
PS/2 family.  Fastgraph provides support for 11 of the 13 modes (modes 8 and
10, which are specific to the PCjr and Tandy 1000 systems, are not
supported).  In addition to these 13 modes, Fastgraph supports six SuperVGA
graphics modes (modes 24 to 29), four extended VGA modes (modes 20 to 23),
and two video modes for the Hercules Graphics Card (modes 11 and 12).  The
following sections discuss these graphics modes in more detail.  The
discussions include an overview of video memory organization in each mode,
but you don't need a knowledge of this subject to use Fastgraph.


CGA Graphics Modes

     Modes 4, 5, and 6 are designed to be used with the Color Graphics
Adapter (CGA) and for this reason are called the native CGA modes.  They were
the only graphics modes available with the original IBM PC.  Newer graphics
adapters (EGA, VGA, MCGA, and SVGA) can emulate the CGA, which means that the
CGA graphics modes are available on any PC or PS/2 system equipped with a
color display.

Mode                     No. of    Supported                Supported
No.  Type Resolution     Colors    Adapters                 Displays

 4   G    320 x 200      4         CGA,EGA,VGA,MCGA,SVGA    RGB,ECD,VGA,SVGA
 5   G    320 x 200      4         CGA,EGA,VGA,MCGA,SVGA    RGB,ECD,VGA,SVGA
 6   G    640 x 200      2/16      CGA,EGA,VGA,MCGA,SVGA    RGB,ECD,VGA,SVGA

Mode 4

     Mode 4 is a CGA graphics mode with a resolution of 320 horizontal pixels
by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of four colors (the
available colors are determined by which one of six palettes has been
selected), so each pixel requires two bits of video memory.  This means that
each byte of video memory represents four pixels.

Mode 5

     Mode 5 is the colorless analog of mode 4.  It was designed to be used
with composite or television monitors (as opposed to RGB monitors).  When
used with these types of monitors, the four colors appear as distinct shades
of gray.  When used with an RGB monitor, mode 5 is essentially identical to
36   Fastgraph User's Guide

mode 4.  The use of composite or television monitors as PC video displays has
virtually disappeared today.  As a result, mode 5 is used infrequently.

Mode 6

     Mode 6 is a CGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640 horizontal pixels
by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume two states -- on or off.  The
color in which the "on" pixels appear can be selected from a palette of 16
available colors.  Each pixel thus requires one bit of video memory, which
means that each byte of video memory represents eight pixels.


Tandy 1000 and PCjr Graphics Modes

     Modes 8, 9, and 10 are only available on the PCjr and Tandy 1000 series
computers (these systems also support modes 4, 5, and 6).  Modes 8 and 10 are
not widely used, and for this reason Fastgraph does not support them.

Mode                     No. of    Supported                Supported
No.  Type Resolution     Colors    Adapters                 Displays

10   G    640 x 200       4        Tandy 1000,PCjr          RGB

Mode 9

     Mode 9 is a Tandy 1000 and PCjr graphics mode with a resolution of 320
horizontal pixels by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 16
colors, so each pixel requires four bits of video memory.  This means that
each byte of video memory represents two pixels.  The Tandy 1000 and PCjr use
standard random-access memory (RAM) as video memory.


Hercules Graphics Modes

     Modes 11 and 12 are used with the Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) and a
monochrome display.  As such, they are not true IBM video modes, but because
of the popularity of the HGC, Fastgraph provides support for this adapter.

Mode                     No. of    Supported                Supported

12   G    320 x 200      b/w       HGC                      Monochrome

Mode 11

     Mode 11 is a true Hercules graphics mode with a resolution of 720
horizontal pixels by 348 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume two
states -- on or off.  Each pixel thus requires one bit of video memory, which
means that each byte of video memory represents eight pixels.
                                      Chapter 2:  PC and PS/2 Video Modes   37
Mode 12

     Mode 12 is a software-simulated Hercules graphics mode with an effective
resolution of 320 horizontal pixels by 200 vertical pixels.  Its purpose is
to provide a resolution that is available with all other graphics display
adapters.

     This mode converts all coordinates from the 320 by 200 space (called
virtual coordinates) into the 720 by 348 coordinate system (called physical
coordinates).  It does this by using two physical pixels for each virtual
pixel and scan doubling the odd-numbered virtual rows.  Finally, offsets are
added to the resulting physical coordinates to center the image area on the
display.  This creates an image area bounded horizontally by the physical
coordinates 40 and 679 and vertically by the physical coordinates 24 and 323.


EGA Graphics Modes

     Modes 13 through 16 were introduced with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter
(EGA) and for this reason are called the native EGA modes.  VGA and SVGA
adapters also provide support for these modes, but the MCGA does not.  The
original IBM EGA only contained 64K bytes of video memory, but memory could
be added in 64K increments to fully populate the adapter with 256K bytes of
video memory.  As other manufacturers developed EGA cards, they generally
included 256K bytes of video memory as a standard feature.

Mode 13

     Mode 13 is an EGA graphics mode with a resolution of 320 horizontal
pixels by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 16 colors, so
each pixel requires four bits of video memory.  In this mode, video memory is
organized as four bit planes.  Each video memory address actually references
four bytes, one in each plane.  Put another way, each video memory byte
references eight pixels, stored one bit per plane.

Mode 14

     Mode 14 is an EGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640 horizontal
pixels by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 16 colors, so
each pixel requires four bits of video memory.  In this mode, video memory is
organized as four bit planes.  Each video memory address actually references
four bytes, one in each plane.  Put another way, each video memory byte
references eight pixels, stored one bit per plane.

Mode 15

     Mode 15 is an EGA monochrome graphics mode with a resolution of 640
horizontal pixels by 350 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 4
display attributes, so each pixel requires two bits of video memory.  In this
38   Fastgraph User's Guide

mode, video memory is organized as four bit planes, two of which are
disabled.  Each video memory address actually references two bytes, one in
each enabled plane.  Put another way, each video memory byte references eight
pixels, stored one bit per plane.

Mode 16

     Mode 16 is an EGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640 horizontal
pixels by 350 vertical pixels.1  Each pixel can assume one of 16 colors (the
16 colors can be selected from a palette of 64 colors), so each pixel
requires four bits of video memory.  In this mode, video memory is organized
as four bit planes.  Each video memory address actually references four
bytes, one in each plane.  Put another way, each video memory byte references
eight pixels, stored one bit per plane.


VGA and MCGA Graphics Modes

     Modes 17, 18, and 19 were introduced with the MCGA and VGA video
subsystems of the IBM PS/2 computers.  Since the introduction of the PS/2,
other manufacturers have developed VGA cards that can be used with the PC
family.  VGA and SVGA adapters support all three of these modes, but the MCGA
does not support mode 18.  Modes 17 and 18 are called native VGA modes.

Mode 17

     Mode 17 is a VGA and MCGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640
horizontal pixels by 480 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume two
states -- on or off.  The color in which the "on" and "off" pixels appear can
be selected from a palette of 262,144 available colors.  Each pixel thus
requires one bit of video memory, which means that each byte of video memory
represents eight pixels.  On VGA and SVGA systems, video memory is organized
as four bit planes, and mode 17 is implemented by enabling one of these
planes.

Mode 18

     Mode 18 is a native VGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640
horizontal pixels by 480 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 16
colors (the 16 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so
each pixel requires four bits of video memory.  In this mode, video memory is
organized as four bit planes.  Each video memory address actually references
four bytes, one in each plane.  Put another way, each video memory byte
references eight pixels, stored one bit per plane.

     (1) In mode 16, the video page size actually is 640 by 400 pixels, though
the screen resolution is 640 by 350.  The final 50 pixel rows (350 to 399) on
each video page are not displayed but are available for off-screen storage.

Mode 19

     Mode 19 is a VGA and MCGA graphics mode with a resolution of 320
horizontal pixels by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 256
colors (the 256 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so
each pixel requires eight bits of video memory.  This means that each byte of
video memory represents one pixel.


Extended VGA (XVGA) Graphics Modes

     Modes 20 through 23 are the extended VGA or XVGA graphics modes.
Although these video modes are not standard VGA modes, they will work on any
register-compatible VGA or SVGA adapter.  These video modes are especially
popular for game development because they offer video page resizing, whereas
the standard 256-color mode does not.  Mode 20 is the XVGA version of mode
19, while mode 21 uses scan doubling to achieve a 400-line display.  Mode 22
is the so-called "mode X" and is appealing because it has a 1:1 aspect ratio.
Mode 23 is identical to mode 22, but it uses scan doubling to achieve a 480-
line display.

Mode 20

     Mode 20 is an XVGA graphics mode with a resolution of 320 horizontal
pixels by 200 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 256 colors (the
256 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so each pixel
requires eight bits of video memory.  This means that each byte of video
memory represents one pixel.  This mode offers the same resolution and number
of colors as mode 19, but its video memory is organized as a series of four
bit planes.  Every fourth pixel is stored in the same plane (that is, a pixel
whose horizontal coordinate is x resides in plane x mod 4).

Mode 21

     Mode 21 is an XVGA color graphics mode with a resolution of 320
horizontal pixels by 400 vertical pixels.  Except for the resolution, its
video memory organization is identical to mode 20.

Mode 22

     Mode 22 is an XVGA color graphics mode with a resolution of 320
horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.  This is the so-called "mode X"
made famous by Michael Abrash in Dr. Dobb's Journal.  Except for the
resolution, its video memory organization is identical to mode 20.

Mode 23

     Mode 23 is an XVGA color graphics mode with a resolution of 320
horizontal pixels by 480 vertical pixels.  Except for the resolution, its
video memory organization is identical to mode 20.


SuperVGA (SVGA) Graphics Modes

     Modes 24 through 29 are the SuperVGA or SVGA graphics modes.  If you've
done any work with SVGA cards, you probably know that different manufacturers
use different numbers to reference the SVGA video modes.  For example, the
640 by 480 256-color graphics mode number is 62 hex on ATI cards, 5D hex on
Trident cards, and 2E hex on Tseng Labs cards.  Fastgraph's SVGA kernel,
described in detail in the next chapter, handles the details of mapping
Fastgraph's general SVGA video mode numbers (24 to 29) to the chipset-
specific video mode numbers of the supported SVGA cards.

Mode 24

     Mode 24 is a SuperVGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640 horizontal
pixels by 400 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 256 colors (the
256 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so each pixel
requires eight bits of video memory.  This means that each byte of video
memory represents one pixel, so at least 256K of video memory is needed for
this mode.  Note that a fair number of SVGA cards do not support this video
mode.

Mode 25

     Mode 25 is a SuperVGA graphics mode with a resolution of 640 horizontal
pixels by 480 vertical pixels.  It is probably the most popular SVGA graphics
mode.  Each pixel can assume one of 256 colors (the 256 colors can be
selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so each pixel requires eight bits
of video memory.  This means that each byte of video memory represents one
pixel, so at least 512K of video memory is needed for this mode.

Mode 26

     Mode 26 is a SuperVGA graphics mode with a resolution of 800 horizontal
pixels by 600 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 256 colors (the
256 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so each pixel
requires eight bits of video memory.  This means that each byte of video
memory represents one pixel, so at least 512K of video memory is needed for
this mode.

Mode 27

     Mode 27 is a SuperVGA graphics mode with a resolution of 1024 horizontal
pixels by 768 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 256 colors (the
256 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so each pixel
requires eight bits of video memory.  This means that each byte of video
memory represents one pixel, so at least 768K of video memory is needed for
this mode.


Mode 28

     Mode 28 is a SuperVGA graphics mode with a resolution of 800 horizontal
pixels by 600 vertical pixels.  Each pixel can assume one of 16 colors (the
16 colors can be selected from a palette of 262,144 colors), so each pixel
requires four bits of video memory.  In this mode, video memory is organized
as four bit planes.  Each video memory address actually references four
bytes, one in each plane.  Put another way, each video memory byte references
eight pixels, stored one bit per plane.  At least 256K of video memory is
needed to use this mode.
