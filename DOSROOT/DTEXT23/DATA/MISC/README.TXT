(1) dynatext.ini is an *extra* copy of the DYNATEXT.INI file.
The file contained here is NOT used by DynaText.

A copy of this file, with the necessary variables set to the proper
places, is necessary for running the software and must exist in either your
WINDOWS directory or the directory that contains the DynaText executables.

     >>>  MKBOOK  ALERT!  <<<

In DynaText 2.2, Mkbook is a DOS command-line program. It is one
of several DOS Publishing Tools, including PUBBOOK.EXE, MKCOLIDX.EXE,
SGMLRVW.EXE, EBTUPD.EXE, and EBTCERT.EXE.   All of these commands 
require a MKBOOK.INI file. These executables were installed in the 
installation's BIN directory.

The MKBOOK.INI file must live in the SAME directory as these executables.
