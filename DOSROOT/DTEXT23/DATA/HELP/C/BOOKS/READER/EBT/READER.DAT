REF1="DynaText Browser. See Browser." REF2=""The DynaText Browser is a unique, powerful product that allows you to access information
in an online environment. When you use the DynaText Browser, you read electronic
books that appear in windows on your screen. You can read DynaText books linearly,
but because the Browser can display information using hypertext and hypermedia,
you can also navigate through information non-linearly, following the sorts
of intuitive connections that your mind makes.ID="bOverUsers"DynaText system usersThe DynaText system has two types of users:name='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183

Browser.ID="bBookAnalogy"The book analogyENTRY="Browser|description" REF1="Browser" REF2="description"You, the reader, read books using the Browser. Groups of books are organized
into collections by the publisher. You can view one collection's books or the books
of many collections at once. As is the case with traditional books, you can place
bookmarks or jot a note in the margin. Unlike reading a traditional book,
with the Browser you can create your own cross-references within an electronic
book.ID="bBrowserFeats"Browser featuresENTRY="Browser|features" REF1="Browser" REF2="features"The DynaText Browser provides a variety of features designed to help you find
information with extraordinary speed and flexibility. The Browser enhances
the act of reading with a set of powerful, online facilities. In the Browser,

	descr='[bull]' The Browser makes it easy to move to specific parts of the book and search
for specific words, phrases, or word or character patterns.name='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183 
	descr='[bull]' While reading a book, you can also see linked information that supports and
enhances the text. You can immediately view footnotes or endnotes, cross-references,
and even information from external programs.name='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183 
	descr='[bull]' DynaText allows publishers who create the books that you read to design
views of the book that can simulate, and improve on, the way text looks on
the printed page. For example, a publisher can create two views of a book:
one that displays introductory information for readers unfamiliar with the
book's content and one for readers who are more experienced with the book's
content.ID="bHyperNavig"Hypertext navigationENTRY="Hypertext|navigation" REF1="Hypertext" REF2="navigation"In addition to its other features, the DynaText Browser is also a hypertext product.
This means that you can move rapidly and non-sequentially through book text
and related information. You are using hypertext when you click onname='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183

view the text and the linked information or you scroll to the linked information.Linked information can be any of a wide variety of media, such as graphics,
tables, animations, audio, and digitized video. The publisher of the electronic
book has the power and flexibility to join together these diverse forms of
information into a powerful whole. The result is a reading experience impossible
to create with paper alone. When your publisher includes other media in your
electronic book, you are not only using hypertext, but also hypermedia.ID="mConventions"Conventions Used in this ManualID="bConventionsIntro"IntroductionENTRY="Conventions used in this manual" REF1="Conventions used in this manual"This section contains an overview of the content of this manual.

tasks: journals, printing, and sources of help.ID="bFontsFormat"Fonts and formattingThroughout this manual, filenames, directories, and pathnames are italicized: TYPE="file"dynatext.ini. The names of buttons in the Button bar are also italicized (for example, TYPE="button"Mark).Anything that should be typed in directly is displayed in Courier font. Often, we refer to cascading menu options using a shorthand method. To refer
to the TYPE="menu"Create Note menu option, available by first selecting TYPE="menu"Create Annotation from the TYPE="menu"Book menu, we use the simpler: TYPE="menu"Book|Create Annotation|Create Note.ID="bKeyCuts"Keyboard shortcutsENTRY="Keyboard shortcuts" REF1="Keyboard shortcuts"Windows software often contains command accelerators and keyboard equivalents
that speed your use of the product by keeping your hands on the keyboard while
you are working.The notation Ctrl-V represents holding down the Ctrl key while pressing v.
Ctrl-V is a command accelerator for the Paste action. The notation Alt, F,
O, B represents pressing and releasing each of these keys in sequence. This
keyboard equivalent performs the same action as selecting TYPE="menu"File|Open|Book. Most menu options have keyboard equivalents. The underlined letter
in the menu name or menu option is the letter to use in the keyboard equivalent
for the menu option.ID="mWinEnviron"Using the Windows EnvironmentENTRY="Windows" REF1="Windows"ID="bWinEnvironIntro"IntroductionTo use the Windows version of the DynaText Browser, you should have some familiarity

how to display alternative views of your book and how to work with graphics

publisher can choose to display the book's information. At your publisher's
discretion, they can create alternative "views" of the information in a book.For example, a book might have a standard view and a large text view so
that readers can read the text that is most comfortable to their eyes. Or,
a book might have a novice view, hiding advanced information, and an expert
view, hiding introductory information. You might view a table of the book's
contents or a table of figures in the TOC view.Whether in the Table of Contents or Main view, we call these different ways of looking
at the book alternative views.ID="bOverGraphics"Getting more out of a book's graphicsIf there are graphics in your books, they may appear inline or they may

REF1="Search language. See also Search."ENTRY="Search. See also Search language." REF1="Search. See also Search language."ID="bSearchOverIntro"IntroductionDynaText supports a very powerful method for searching through a book. Using
ordinary characters, wildcards and certain keywords, you are able to direct
a search to complex patterns, specific sections, and other aspects of the
book. These keywords form the DynaText search language.ID="bOverTypes"Types of searchesThe search language supports the following types of searches:name='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183 
	descr='[bull]'a word or phrasename='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183 
	descr='[bull]'a word or phrase that is near another word or phrasename='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183 
	descr='[bull]'a pattern that matches several words or phrasesname='bull' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=183 
	descr='[bull]'a group of words together or near each otherNote: In addition to these types of searches, DynaText supports
restricting any search to a particular context in the book (for example, searching
only within titles of chapters). You can also locate a particular part of
a book (for example, a chapter or a title) that contains a word or phrase.
These types of searches require knowledge of the internal breakdown or "tagging"
of the document. If you are not familiar with the book's tagging, you can
ignore these additional types of searches.ID="bOverSrchLang"Using the DynaText search languageIf you want a search to be more generalized than a simple word or phrase,
you can use the DynaText search language to search for patterns. Or, if you want to narrow
a search to find a word near another word, you do so with the DynaText search language.ID="bOverNoSrch"What you cannot search forThere are certain words and characters that you cannot search for. This

out, the DynaText search language supports two wildcards to enable you to search for words
and phrases that contain only certain letters or patterns of letters.ID="bSearching"WildcardsWildcards are characters that can stand for any other character, including
itself. The DynaText search language provides two wildcard characters, * and ?.

the word "motorcycle" or occurrences of the word "tricycle". DynaText will then
highlight occurrences of both words in the document.Note: The searchdownhill or cross country skiwill search for either the word "downhill" or the phrase "cross country
ski."  To find either kind of skiing, try the third example in the list above.The and operator provides a more restrictive search. The "and" search
reports all cases of either of the phrases that are near each other. For example,pitcher and catcherthermos and coffee potThese are counted as how many times each occurs, as the total number of
occurrences of both.The not keyword can be used with and and or to negate
the word that follows it. For example, the boolean search:cross country and not skimight be used to find occurrences of cross country that refer to long-distance
running without finding references to skiing.ID="bContextSrch"Context searchesENTRY="Search|context" REF1="Search" REF2="context"Context searches allow you to find information within specific document

within your document, rather than have them signal a type of search to the
search function. In that case, you must use them between double quotes, either
by quoting the keyword itself or by quoting the entire phrase in which the
keyword appears. Example: Search for the phrase "hole in one" by entering

function, due to their excessive frequency. Generally, the stop list includes
very common words that are seldom useful to search for: "the," "is," "for,"
"because," and so on. Your publisher determines what words are contained on the stop list.ID="bInterpSLwords"How DynaText interprets stop list wordsWhen you enter a phrase with a word from the stop list, DynaText replaces it
with a space, followed by a *, followed by a space. In other words,
it will replace the stop list word with the * wildcard, which matches any word. The search is then either successful or unsuccessful in special
ways.ID="bSrch4SLwords"How to search for stop list wordsIn a successful search with a stop list word, a popup window displays the
message: "A word is on the stop list." DynaText may indeed have found occurrences
of the phrase or expression that you were looking for. However, it probably
also found other phrases with any other word appearing in the place of the
stop list word.For example, if you perform the search:the documentDynaText will actually look for* documentThis expression matches "the document", but also "classified document",

through one or many electronic books. The Journal tool allows you to do this. RID="cJournal"Chapter 8 describes how to view pre-recorded journals
using the Journal tool. This chapter describes how to record your own journals.The Journal tool has the ability to record the movements you make, allowing
you to create reading paths through books. Within the same journal you can
record locations from various books.The journal that is created provides a way to backtrack through your
browsing session. Journals can be saved so that you or others can follow
the same path again.This DynaText feature is especially useful for training, and for providing
commentary or criticism of texts.ID="bOverRecord"Recording journalsRecording journals involves the following basic steps:TYPE="num"1. opening the Journal tool2. recording and editing the journal entries3. saving the journal fileID="mRecordJrnl"Recording a New JournalENTRY="Journal tool|recording journals" REF1="Journal tool" REF2="recording journals"ID="bRecordJrnlIntro"IntroductionENTRY="journals|recording" REF1="journals" REF2="recording"Using the Journal tool is an easy way to keep a record of each movement you
make in one or multiple books. You can mark a series of locations traveled
(in one book, or many), or parts of books (such as tables or figures) commonly
referred to. In addition, you have the freedom of recording only those events
that you want to record, and editing the journal using standard cut/copy/paste
operations.ID="bWhatRecords"What a journal recordsENTRY="Journal|actions recorded in" REF1="Journal" REF2="actions recorded in"Almost any action in which you move to a new location in a book is recorded
in the Journal tool. For example, moving to a new location using the Table of Contents, opening
a table or raster graphic, following a cross-reference link, and moving through
the document screen by screen using the scroll bar, all create journal entries.Scrolling line by line and opening an annotation or creating one are not recorded. If you open a new book, the first screen of the book is
an entry in the journal, but not the actual action of opening it. This is
also true when you open a new view of a book.ID="bOpenJtool"Opening the Journal toolENTRY="Journal|opening a new" REF1="Journal" REF2="opening a new"ENTRY="Preferences|Journal tool" REF1="Preferences" REF2="Journal tool"ENTRY="Journal tool|setting preferences" REF1="Journal tool" REF2="setting preferences"Click the Journal icon in the button bar, or select TYPE="menu"Journal|New from the menu to open the Journal tool and record a new journal.

to open or close subsections by mistake. What am I doing wrong?You are double-clicking on the plus or minus signs to the left of the titles.
To select a title and scroll to that section in the book, you need only click
once, directly on the title.ID="bGenQ2"Question 2 If I want to quit DynaText and I have one or more books open, do I need
to close the book(s) individually before quitting?No, save time by selecting TYPE="menu"File|Exit to close
books and leave DynaText.ID="bGenQ3"Question 3 How can I get help information for a Main view?These help topics are available under the TYPE="menu"Help
menu in the menu bar when the Book window is the active window. ID="bGenQ4"Question 4 Can I change Windows defaults for DynaText windows?Yes. You can change geometry, colors, and many other features using the TYPE="file"dynatext.ini file. If you are not familiar with this file,
do not make any changes without first consulting your system administrator.ID="bGenQ5"Question 5 I am getting error messages about fonts not being found. What can I
do?Ask your System Administrator to ensure that all fonts needed by DynaText books
are installed. ID="mQASearch"Questions and Answers on SearchingENTRY="Questions and answers|on searching" REF1="Questions and answers" REF2="on searching"ID="bSrchQ1"Question 1Why doesn't DynaText perform my search when I type a word?You must press the TYPE="key"Return key, or the TYPE="button"Next button to start the search.ID="bSrchQ2"Question 2 Will using the search language slow down my searches? No, not noticeably. If you do very general searches, such as '*ing' or
 'b*', DynaText may take quite a while to find all occurrences of such regular
expressions. However, DynaText will handle with ease more refined searches, such
as 'for?' (which matches words such as 'fort', 'fork,' and so on).ID="bSrchQ3"Question 3 How can I correct typing errors in the search word(s) I'm typing?Both the TYPE="key"Backspace  and TYPE="key"Delete keys will work, according to Windows standards. In addition, you can
highlight the portion that you wish to change, then press Backspace to delete
it, or start typing to replace it.ID="bSrchQ4"Question 4 The only report I see when I do a search is "|" or nothing next to titles
in the Table of Contents view. Why?Searching Preferences are set to report only "On/Off"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'that is, whether
your search word(s) occur in a given section or not. You can change this option
by selecting TYPE="menu"File|Preferences from the menu bar.ID="bSrchQ5"Question 5 When I do a search, the numbers in the Table of Contents view do not add up to the
total number of search occurrences for the whole book. What's more, the numbers
appearing in the Table of Contents are smaller than the actual number of occurrences.
Why?Searching Preferences are set to report "Relevance"name='mdash' font=symbol charset=fontspecific code=190 
			descr='[mdash]'that is, the
relative number of search occurrences. These numbers are generated by computing
the log of the actual number of search occurrences. You can change this option
by selecting TYPE="menu"File|Preferences from the menu bar.ID="bSrchQ6"Question 6 Why doesn't the display move when I click the TYPE="button"Next or TYPE="button"Prev button?  I just get a beep sound.If you are already at the last occurrence of your search word, there is
no next occurrence to display, which is signaled by a beep if you click TYPE="button"Next. In the same way, if you are already at the first
occurrence of your search word and click TYPE="button"Prev,
you get a beep.ID="bSrchQ7"Question 7 What is a "stop list"?A stop list is a list of words that are not included in the index of the
book. Generally, the stop list includes common words that are seldom useful
to search for: the, it, is, and so forth.If you search for such a word, a box appears saying "A word is on the stop
list." In this case, try searching instead for a word more specific to the
thing about which you want to find information.If you search for a phrase that contains a stop list word, you receive
the same message, but the search is still performed. The highlighted search
occurrences will look like your search phrase with any word in the place of
the stop list word. For example, if you search for "close the door", DynaText
will also highlight "close my door".ID="mQAPrint"Questions and Answers on PrintingENTRY="Questions and answers|on printing" REF1="Questions and answers" REF2="on printing"ID="bPrintQ1"Question 1 Can I print the Table of Contents for the book?You can print the Table of Contents if an outline stylesheet is made available by your
book publisher. Names of the printing stylesheet will vary, so ask your book
publisher if you are unsure of the output of a particular print stylesheet.ID="bPrintQ2"Question 2 Why do I get error messages about the book font when I try to print
the book I'm reading? The publisher who created the stylesheets for the book you are reading
may have included a font that is not installed on your local system. See your
system administrator to have the necessary fonts installed, or to modify the
stylesheet.ID="bPrintQ3"Question 3 Can I print individual DynaText windows?Yes, using the Windows Clipboard and Paintbrush accessories. See Chapter
2 of the Windows User's Guide for more information.ID="bPrintQ4"Question 4When I am selecting sections to print, I can't see all of the Table
of Contents because the printing dialog box is in the way. What can I do?Windows is still working, and you can use the usual methods to bring any
window to the front, or to move windows around.ID="bPrintQ5"Question 5How can I control the formatting of printed output?Select the desired printing stylesheet from the Print dialog box. These
views are specified by the book publisher.ID="bPrintQ6"Question 6How can I send printed output to a different physical printer?Output goes to your default printer, set through the Windows Control Panel.
If you need to change this and do not know how, consult your Windows documentation
or your system administrator.ID="bPrintQ7"Question 7Will printed output include graphics, footnotes, and other linked information?Whether or not graphics or footnotes are printed is at the discretion of
the publisher. If footnotes are printed, they will appear in the body of the
text, not at the bottom of the page or the end of the document. Neither cross-reference hyperlink icons
nor their targets will appear in the printout.You determine whether notes (attached by readers) appear in the output
by clicking on the Print Notes box on the Print dialog box.
