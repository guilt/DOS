1.0.0 Installation Notes
------------------------

1.1.0 Installing Over Existing UltraSound Software
--------------------------------------------------
If you experience problems after installing this new set of software,
simply delete your UltraSound directory and re-install.

1.1.1 Users with 16-Bit Recording Option (Daughter Board)
---------------------------------------------------------
The install will not auto-detect the presence of a 16-bit recording
board.  To configure the 16-bit recording card for Windows, double click 
on the UltraSound Configuration icon in the Gravis Program Group in 
Windows. Under "card type," select "16-bit recording card."  If you do 
not do this,  you may not hear anything under Windows.

1.1.2 Important Note on Choosing the Base Address
-------------------------------------------------
If your CD-ROM drive uses address 3x0 Hex, DO NOT choose 2x0 Hex for
your UltraSound base address, or your computer may crash.  'X' denotes a 
port address. (For example, if your CD-ROM address is 320 Hex, do not 
choose 220Hex for your UltraSound base address.)

1.1.3 Temporary Directories
---------------------------
After installation a temporary directory, ADMALTOI or ISFYZQVO.TWJ,
may be left undeleted on some systems. These directories can be safely deleted.
  
2.0.0 Setting up for Windows
----------------------------
The UltraSound uses buffers to store sound information when playing and
recording digital data.  The size of these buffers can affect the 
performance of the UltraSound in certain applications.  The buffer size 
can be changed in Windows by choosing the UltraSound Configuration icon 
for the Gravis program group under Windows.  You can then type in a new 
value for "buf size" in the sections for DMA Channel A and DMA Channel 
B.  The default buffer size of 4096 bytes generally gives the best 
results when recording and playing back data.  The largest buffer size 
is 8192 bytes.  Applications such as voice recognition can work better 
with a smaller buffer.  If such an application is not working as 
expected, try using a smaller buffer size.  The minimum size is 512.   


3.0.0 Memory upgrades
---------------------
The following is a list of DRAM suitable for upgrading your UltraSound MAX or
UltraSound ACE:

            OKI            #MSM514260A-70JS
            NEC            #uPD42S4260LE-70  (NOTE 2)
            NEC            #uPD424260LE-70   (NOTE 2)
            NEC            #uPD424260LE-60R  (NOTE 3)
            NEC            #uPD42S4260LE-60R (NOTE 3)
            TI             #TM545160DZ-80

Note 1: Memory upgrade kits are available from Gravis.
Note 2: The DRAM indicated above are 60nsec. thru 70nsec. parts.  If
        available, the 80nsec. DRAM may also be used.
Note 3: The "60R" part signifies that the part does not quite meet the
        60nsec. spec.  Basically, it may be considered as a "faster than
        70nsec. but not quite 60nsec." part.
