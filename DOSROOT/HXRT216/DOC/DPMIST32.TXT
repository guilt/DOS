 About DPMIST32.BIN

 DPMIST32.BIN is a stub file supposed to replace the default stub of
 Win32 console mode apps. The replacement is done by:

   - for new executables use a linker option (i.e. /STUB:DPMIST32.BIN)
   - for existing apps use tool PEStub.exe

 The modified application should run as before as long as it runs in a
 Win32 environment. In true DOS, however, the stub will gain control
 and try to find and launch HX's PE file loader DPMILD32.EXE. DPMILD32
 will be searched in the current directory and then in the directories
 of the PATH environment variable.
