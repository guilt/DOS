    *    CAUTION!  Make sure that you are running this    *
    *    .EXE file in an empty folder or on a blank       *
    *    formatted diskette!                              *
    *                                                     *
    *    DO NOT run this .EXE file in your \WINDOWS       *
    *    or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder!                       *
    *                                                     *
    *******************************************************

2) Use the INSTSUPP command to install these files to your 
   hard drive.  By default, these files will be installed in
   your Windows\Command folder.

3) Once you have installed the files, you can delete the files 
   from the folder that OLDDOS.EXE was run.


NOTES
-----
After you install the supplemental tools, you must restart your computer
before using them.  This is because INSTSUPP modifies your SETVER table,
and you must restart your computer for the modifications to take effect.
