Several new features have been added to PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX
version 2.04c.  Read the file ADDENDUM.DOC for a complete
description of these changes and enhancements.  Highlights
of PKZIP/PKUNZIP/PKSFX etc. version 2.04c include:

-Improved Compression

	PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c implements a new compression algorithm
	called Deflating.  Deflating has varying levels of compression
	and speed available.  Both speed and compression are greatly
	improved over previous versions of PKZIP.

-Multi-Volume Archive Support/Formatting

	PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c has the ability to "span" a .ZIP file across
	multiple diskettes if the final .ZIP file size would be greater
	than a single diskette.  PKZIP 2.04c also has the ability to
	format the destination diskettes on the fly.

-XMS/EMS Usage

	PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c has the ability to use of EMS, UMB, and HMA
	memory, which will allow the ability to process more files or be
	able to run with less conventional memory.  PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04
	will run in as little as 85K of conventional memory if EMS or
	XMS memory is available.

-Novell Network Aware

	PKZIP 2.04c is Novell Netware "aware".  Updating or creating
	a .ZIP file on a network drive is much faster with the network
	support in PKZIP 2.04c.

-Auto CPU type detection.
	
	PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c will detect what type of CPU it is being run
	on and will use instructions specifcally optimized for an 808x
	CPU, 80386 CPU, or 80486 CPU.

-DPMI support
	
	PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c automatically detects if DPMI (DOS Protected
	Mode Interface) support is available and will execute code in
	32-bit protected mode for better speed.

-PKCFG program

	PKZIP 2.04c can be configured to best suit your needs through
	the use of the PKCFG program.  This is only available in the
	registered version of PKZIP.

-PKSFX Junior and PKUNZIP Junior

	These "Junior" programs use very little memory and are extremely
	small.  Although they are reduced in ability, their small size
	makes them very useful.

-Password Encryption

	Sensitive data files can be scrambled with password protection.
	The security of this feature has been significantly improved in
	PKZIP/PKUNZIP 2.04c.

-Authenticy Verification

	Users requiring authentication of archive files may request an
	Authenticy Verification code.  This allows users to create .ZIP
	files which PKUNZIP can detect tampering of.
