             Release Notes for the Microsoft(R) Source Profiler
                   Performance Analysis Tool, Version 1.2

                  (C) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1992
                                          
     This document contains release notes for version 1.2 of the
     Microsoft Source Profiler Performance Analysis Tool for MS-DOS(R),
     the Microsoft Operating System/2 (MS(R) OS/2(R)), and the Microsoft
     Windows(TM) graphical environment. The information in this document
     and in the Microsoft Advisor (online help) is more up-to-date than
     that in the "Microsoft Source Profiler Users Guide."
  
     Microsoft improves its languages documentation at the time of
     reprinting, so some of the information in this file may already be
     included in the User's Guide.

======================< Part 1: Installation Reminders >====================


     Profiling with Windows

     ----------------------

     Before attempting to profile with Windows, make sure that you
     follow the directions in "Modifying Your Windows Configuration"
     on page 9 of the "Microsoft Source Profiler User's Guide."


     Profiling with the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB)
     -----------------------------------------------

     The TOOLS.PRE file contains key and color assignments for using
     the profiler with PWB. Make sure that you add the contents of this
     file to the [PWB] section of your TOOLS.INI file before running the
     profiler from PWB.

     The profiler PWB extension will load automatically only if the
     extension file (PWBPROF.MXT or PWBPROF.PXT) is in the same directory
     as the PWB executable file (PWB.COM or PWB.EXE).

     The PWB extension shipped with this version of the profiler is
     compatible only with version 2.x of the Programmer's WorkBench;
     it will not work with version 1.0 or 1.1.




========================< Part 2: Notes on VTD.386 >========================


     Reprogramming the Timer
     -----------------------

     The VTD.386 device driver (required for profiling under Microsoft
     Windows) virtualizes the 8253 timer, so DOS programs that reprogram
     the timer or hook to timer interrupt 1Ch may not work correctly in
     a DOS box under Microsoft Windows.




====================< Part 3: Additional Error Messages >===================


     Add the following warning to the list of PREP errors:


     Profiler warning PR4323

     The profiler was unable to find the line number for function
     'function' in the source file.

     The CodeView information in the executable file is inconsistent.
     The information indicates that there is a function, procedure, or
     subroutine at a certain line number, but there was none found on
     that line. The profiler will not profile 'function'.

     This warning can occur if the C++ compiler generated internal
     functions that are not in the source file. It can also occur if you
     are using Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.0 or earlier.
