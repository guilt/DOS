Notes on OODEMO.EXE
-------------------

Usage
-----

TAB changes the active window.

ESC quits.

All windows respond to cursor keys, HOME, END, PGUP, PGDN.

Windows can be moved with Ctrl-U (up), Ctrl-H (left), Ctrl-J (right), 
and Ctrl-N (down).

Windows can be resized with Ctrl-T (shorter), Ctrl-F (narrower), 
Ctrl-G (wider), and Ctrl-V (longer).

DELETE removes active window.

EditWin accepts text input.

Cells can be added or killed from the LifeWin screen, using
either the mouse or the spacebar. Commands can be executed
by clicking mouse on the buttons, or with the keyboard
(C to clear, R to randomize, N to compute next generation.)

Limitations
-----------
Scrollbar sliders cannot be dragged. There is no "auto-repeat"
for the end arrows; i.e. holding down the mouse button will
not cause continuous scrolling. There is no bounds-checking
to prevent windows from being moved off the screen.
