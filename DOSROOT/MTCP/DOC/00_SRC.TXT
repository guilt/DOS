Welcome to the mTCP source code!

  In this archive you will find the source code for the DOS portions of
  mTCP.  (The mTCP NetDrive server is in a different archive.)

  For detailed information on how the source code is structured please
  see the developers.pdf file.  Topics include the directory structure,
  what compiler to use, architecture and design notes, and miscellaneous
  notes for programming under DOS.

  Note: HTTPServ source code is not provided at this time.  It is a very
  complex piece of code and even though it is stable, I'd like to fix
  a few things to make it more robust.


Support

  I want you to have a great experience with mTCP and I provide support
  via email.  Please send your questions, bug reports and feature requests
  to me to me at the email address listed above.  There is also a low-volume
  mailing list you can subscribe to at https://groups.google.com/g/mtcp.

  The latest mTCP code and documentation can always be found at
  the home page listed above.  That is the official homepage for mTCP
  that I maintain.  Other sites may have mTCP available for download but
  I don't attempt to audit or verify those versions and they might be
  stale or have changes that I don't know about.  (Or they might have some
  really great code too ...)

  If you are running an older version of mTCP please try the latest
  version first before contacting me; your problem might be a bug
  that has already been fixed.  You can use SERVICES.BAT to do a quick
  check to see if a new version is available right from your DOS machine.


  Don't understand the documentation?  That might be my fault.  Send me
  an email with your question and I'll try to make it more clear.

  Can't make it work?  There could be lots of reasons.  I try to explain
  the common problems in the PDF documentation.  If you have something
  that is truly uncommon and you are tired of banging your head on the
  wall send me an email.  There might be a bug or you might just need
  a gentle prod in the right direction.

  If you do ask for help via email please send me the following:

  - the version of mTCP you are running.
  - the class/type of hardware you are running on. (e.g.: Compaq Portable,
    PCjr, PS/2, DOSBox, generic Pentium, virtual machine, etc.)
  - the version of DOS you are using.
  - the details of your problem including what you think the problem is,
    what server you are connecting to, how to recreate the problem, etc.

  If your problem is complex I may ask you to collect traces using the
  mTCP debug features.  Usually we can get to the bottom of the problem.


Like what you see?  Want to say thanks?

  Thank you!  I have never accepted any money, beer or cookies for my work.
  If you want to say thanks in a tangible way I've never seen an animal
  shelter that was over-funded.

  I also have mTCP stickers to hand out if you ever see me in person.


Licensing

  This version of mTCP is available as open source software under the
  terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.  Please see
  COPYING.TXT which includes the terms of the license.

  In short, share and enjoy while respecting the license.  Although
  it is open source software I still maintain the copyright to all of
  my contributions.  As I retain my copyright I am able to offer other
  licenses; please contact me if you have a special project that requires
  a different license.

  The source code is available at (you guessed it!) the mTCP home page
  listed above.  It may be mirrored at other places but I don't have
  any control over those copies and I don't attempt to audit them or
  verify them.

  This code is free to use.  There is no warranty of any kind.  While I
  take pride in my work, this is a hobby project so if it burns down your
  house, causes an Martian invasion, or gives you indigestion I will
  feel badly but I am not legally responsible.

Lastly, enjoy!
