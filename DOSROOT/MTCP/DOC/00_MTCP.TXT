Welcome to mTCP!

  mTCP is a set of TCP/IP applications designed to run well on older x86
  personal computers running DOS.  Applications include:

   - DHCP.EXE, a DHCP client for simple network configuration
   - DNSTEST.EXE, a DNS name resolver
   - FTP.EXE, an FTP client
   - FTPSRV.EXE, an FTP server
   - HTGET.EXE for fetching files from web servers
   - HTTPSERV.EXE for serving files on the web using HTTP 0.9, 1.0 or 1.1
   - IRCJR.EXE, an IRC client for chatting on IRC networks
   - NC.EXE, a version of netcat for sending and receiving data using TCP/IP
   - PING.EXE, a network diagnostic utility
   - PKTTOOL.EXE, a utility (traffic sniffing and packet driver stats)
   - SERVICES.BAT, a utility to check for mTCP updates
   - SNTP.EXE, a Simple Network Time Protocol client for synching your clock
   - SPDTEST.EXE, a program for benchmarking your TCP/IP network speed
   - TELNET.EXE, a Telnet client with reasonable good ANSI terminal emulation

  Also included are NETDRIVE.SYS (a device driver) and NETDRIVE.EXE (the
  utility program for the device driver) which enable network attached
  storage for your DOS machine.

  The TCP/IP code is compiled into each application allowing for each
  application to choose the features that they need.  This approach allows
  for better performance, stability, and per-application customization
  not possible with other approaches, such as a DOS TSR.

  Detailed end user documentation can be found in the mtcp.pdf file which
  you can download from the home page.

  Included sample files are:

   - SAMPLE.CFG, a sample mTCP configuration file
   - FTPPASS.TXT, a sample password file for the FTP server


Getting started

  Please download the PDF documentation from the home page.  The documention
  has a comprehensive set of instructions for getting started. Here is the
  very quick version:

  1. Create an mTCP configuration file (a one-time process).
  2. Set an environment variable (MTCPCFG) to point at the configuration file.
  3. Load the packet driver for your Ethernet card.
  4. Run an mTCP program ...

Support 

  I want you to have a great experience with mTCP and I provide support
  via email.  Please send your questions, bug reports and feature requests
  to me to me at the email address listed above.  There is also a low-volume
  mailing list you can subscribe to at https://groups.google.com/g/mtcp.

  The latest mTCP code and documentation can always be found at
  the home page listed above.  That is the official homepage for mTCP
  that I maintain.  Other sites may have mTCP available for download but
  I don't attempt to audit or verify those versions and they might be
  stale or have changes that I don't know about.  (Or they might have some
  really great code too ...)

  If you are running an older version of mTCP please try the latest
  version first before contacting me; your problem might be a bug
  that has already been fixed.  You can use SERVICES.BAT to do a quick
  check to see if a new version is available right from your DOS machine.

  Don't understand the documentation?  That might be my fault.  Send me
  an email with your question and I'll try to make it more clear.

  Can't make it work?  There could be lots of reasons.  I try to explain
  the common problems in the PDF documentation.  If you have something
  that is truly uncommon and you are tired of banging your head on the
  wall send me an email.  There might be a bug or you might just need
  a gentle prod in the right direction.

  If you do ask for help via email please send me the following:

  - the version of mTCP you are running.
  - the class/type of hardware you are running on. (e.g.: Compaq Portable,
    PCjr, PS/2, DOSBox, generic Pentium, virtual machine, etc.)
  - the version of DOS you are using.
  - the details of your problem including what you think the problem is,
    what server you are connecting to, how to recreate the problem, etc.

  If your problem is complex I may ask you to collect traces using the
  mTCP debug features.  Usually we can get to the bottom of the problem.


Like what you see?  Want to say thanks?

  Thank you!  I have never accepted any money, beer or cookies for my work.
  If you want to say thanks in a tangible way I've never seen an animal
  shelter that was over-funded.

  I also have mTCP stickers to hand out if you ever see me in person.
