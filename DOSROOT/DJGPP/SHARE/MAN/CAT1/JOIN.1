       For  each  pair of input lines with identical join fields,
       write a line to standard output.  The default  join  field
       is  the  first,  delimited  by  whitespace.  When FILE1 or
       FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

       --aa SIDE

       Unless --tt CHAR is given, leading  blanks  separate  fields
       and  are  ignored, else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any
       FIELD is a field number counted from 1.  FORMAT is one  or
       more  comma  or blank separated specifications, each being
       `SIDE.FIELD' or `0'.   Default  FORMAT  outputs  the  join
       field,  the  remaining  fields  from  FILE1, the remaining
       fields from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.
