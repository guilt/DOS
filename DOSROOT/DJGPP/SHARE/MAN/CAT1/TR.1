       SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most  repre-
       sent themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character  with  octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal dig-
              its)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1  to  CHAR2  in  ascending
              order

       Translation  occurs  if  --dd is not given and both SET1 and
       SET2 appear.  --tt may be used only when translating.   SET2
       is  extended to length of SET1 by repeating its last char-
       acter  as  necessary.   Excess  characters  of  SET2   are
       ignored.   Only  [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to

       --ss uses SET1 if not translating nor deleting; else squeez-
       ing uses SET2 and occurs after translation or deletion.
