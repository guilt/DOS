       sort - sort lines of text files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard out-
       put.

       +POS1 [-POS2]
              start a key at POS1, end it *before* POS2 (obsoles-
              cent)

              field  numbers  and  character offsets are numbered
              starting with zero (contrast with the --kk option)

       --bb     ignore leading blanks in sort fields or keys

       --cc     check if given files already sorted, do not sort

       --dd     consider only [a-zA-Z0-9 ] characters in keys

       --ff     fold lower case to upper case characters in keys

       --gg     compare according to general numerical value, imply
              --bb

       --ii     consider only [ 40- 176] characters in keys

       --kk POS1[,POS2]
              start a key at POS1, end it *at* POS2

              field  numbers  and  character offsets are numbered
              starting with one (contrast  with  zero-based  +POS
              form)

       --mm     merge already sorted files, do not sort

       --MM     compare (unknown) < `JAN' < ... < `DEC', imply --bb

       --nn     compare  according to string numerical value, imply
              --bb

       --oo FILE
              write result on FILE instead of standard output

       --rr     reverse the result of comparisons

       --ss     stabilize sort by disabling last resort comparison

       --tt SEP use SEParator instead of non- to whitespace transi-

       --TT DIRECTORY
              use  DIRECTORY  for temporary files, not $TMPDIR or
              /tmp

       --uu     with --cc, check for strict ordering; with  --mm,  only
              output the first of an equal sequence

       --zz     end  lines  with  0  byte,  not  newline,  for find
              --pprriinntt00

       ----hheellpp display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       POS is F[.C][OPTS], where F is the field number and C  the
       character  position  in  the  field, both counted from one
       with --kk, from zero with the  obsolescent  form.   OPTS  is
       made  up  of one or more of Mbdfinr; this effectively dis-
       ables global --MMbbddffiinnrr settings for that key.  If no key is
       given,  use  the entire line as the key.  With no FILE, or
       when FILE is -, read standard input.
