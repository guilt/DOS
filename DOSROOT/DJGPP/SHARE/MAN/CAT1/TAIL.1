       Print  the  last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.
       With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving
       the  file  name.   With  no  FILE, or when FILE is -, read
       standard input.

       ----rreettrryy
              keep trying to open a file even if it is

              inaccessible when tail  starts  or  if  it  becomes
              inaccessible later ---- useful only with --ff

       --cc, ----bbyytteess=_N

              --ff,  ----ffoollllooww[[=={name|descriptor}]  output  appended
              data as the file grows;

              --ff, ----ffoollllooww, and ----ffoollllooww=_d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r  are  equiva-

TAIL(1)                        FSF                        TAIL(1)


       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       If the first character of N (the number of bytes or lines)
       is a `+', print beginning with the Nth item from the start
       of  each  file,  otherwise,  print the last N items in the
       file.  N may have a multiplier suffix: b for  512,  k  for
       1024,  m for 1048576 (1 Meg).  A first OPTION of --VVAALLUUEE or
       +VALUE is treated like --nn VALUE or --nn +VALUE unless  VALUE
       has  one of the [bkm] suffix multipliers, in which case it
       is treated like --cc VALUE or --cc +VALUE.

       With ----ffoollllooww (-f), tail defaults to  following  the  file
       descriptor,  which  means  that  even if a tail'ed file is
       renamed, tail  will  continue  to  track  its  end.   This
       default  behavior is not desirable when you really want to
       track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor
       (e.g.,  log  rotation).   Use  ----ffoollllooww=_n_a_m_e in that case.
       That causes tail to track the named file by  reopening  it
       periodically  to  see if it has been removed and recreated
       by some other program.

       The full documentation for ttaaiill is maintained as a Texinfo
       manual.   If  the  iinnffoo  and  ttaaiill  programs  are properly
       installed at your site, the command

              iinnffoo ttaaiill

       should give you access to the complete manual.
