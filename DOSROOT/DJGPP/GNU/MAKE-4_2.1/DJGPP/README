This is a port of GNU make 4.2.1  to MSDOS/DJGPP.

  Make is a program for building other programs, given a description of
  the dependencies between the files.



1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        This port has been configured using DJGPP 2.05.  It has been configured
        to be build in the "_build" directory.

        The port has been configured and compiled on WinXP SP3 and on Win98SE.
        There is no guarantee that this may be possible with any other DOS-like
        OS.  Due to the use of long file names it will not be possible to
        configure and compile without LFN support.

        The DJGPP 2.05 version of the port has been compiled using gcc510 and
        bnu225br3.

        The most important DJGPP specific change is that I have removed the
        dependence of guile.  AFAIK there is no DJGPP port of guile and I
        assume that there will never be.  This means that all make extensions
        that require the use of guile will never be available for DJGPP.

        The test suite requires perl and fails completely.  This is because it
        checks for the perl fork() functionality that is not supported by the
        current DJGPP port of perl.

        The port now uses the same configuration files than most of all the
        other DJGPP ports.  These files are stored together with the diffs
        file in the /djgpp directory.  This has the benefity that it becomes
        easier to support NLS and other features that may require to adjust
        the configure script and the Makefile.ins.  The original build system
        is fully functional and supported by this port.

        The port has been configured and compiled with NLS support enabled using
        the latest ports of libiconv and gettext.

          ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/beta/v2gnu/gtxt192b.zip
        If you prefer to compile a version without NLS support use the original
        build system.
        Please note that because the port has been compiled with NLS support
        using the DXE3 module versions of the gettext and iconv libraries it
        is MANDATORY to install both gtxt192b and licv114br2 ports or the make
        program will not work at all.

        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, README files,
        etc.) are stored in the /djgpp directory.

        For further information about GNU make please read the info docs and NEWS file.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 mak421b.zip      or
          djtarx mak421b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d mak421b.zip


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 mak421s.zip      or
          djtarx mak421s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d mak421s.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev205.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh205bbr3.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, gppNNN.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip,
          shlNNNb.zip, txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip, grepNNNb.zip, sedNNNb.zip,
          mktmpNNb.zip and gwkNNNb.zip.

        If you want to configure and compile this packages with NLS support
        enabled you must install licvNNNb.zip, lunsNNNb.zip and gtxNNNNb.zip.

        If you want to run the check you will need also:
          difNNNb.zip and mktmpNNNb.zip

        NNN represents the latest version number of the binary packages.  All
        this packages can be found in the /v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.
        You will need bsh205bbr3.zip or later and *NOT* a prior version or
        the build will fail.  The same applies to djdev205.zip.

3.3.:   The package has been configured for DJGPP 2.05.  There is a separate
        build directory under the top srcdir (aka make-4.2.1).  To build
        the binaries cd into _build directory.  If for some reason you want to
        reconfigure the package cd into the build directory and run the following
        commands:
          del config.cache
          make clean
          ..\djgpp\config ./..

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the /djgpp
        directory or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.

        config.bat, among other things, will start the configure script passing
        to it a couple of arguments.  You can control these argument passing the
        following command line arguments to config.bat:
          nls or no-nls, default nls.  NLS support enabled.
          cache or no-cache, default cache.  Cache in build directory.
          dep or no-dep, default no-dep.  No dependency tracking.
        All other configure specific options are not set by config.bat so their
        values are left as they are.  If no arguments are passed to config.bat
        then the default values are used.


        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\make-4.2.1\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/make-4.2.1

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\make-4.2.1\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/make-4.2.1

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter.  You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.in's and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.

3.4.:   To compile the package run from the directory where you have configured
        the sources the command:
          make

3.5.:   The test suite does not work at all due to limitations inherent to the
        DJGPP port of perl (fork not supported).

3.6.:   To install the binaries and info docs run the following command from
        the directory where you have configured the sources:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropriate
        value:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/place
