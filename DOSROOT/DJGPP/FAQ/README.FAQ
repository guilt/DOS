This is version 2.30 of the FAQ list for DJGPP.  DJGPP is a port of
the GNU C/C++ compiler and GNU development tools to 32-bit,
protected-mode environment under MS-DOS and compatible systems.

To install the on-line versions of the FAQ, you should unzip the
`faq230b.zip' archive with "unzip" or "PKUNZIP -d" command from the
root directory of your DJGPP installation tree.  (On Windows 9X use an
unzip program that supports long file names.)  The FAQ in the Info
format will be extracted into the info/ subdirectory; other files will
be extracted into the FAQ/ subdirectory.  

You can then browse the FAQ by e.g. invoking the stand-alone Info
reader info.exe from the DOS prompt, like this:

     info faq

Alternatively, use a text file browser to read `djgppfaq.txt' or a Web
browser to read `djgppfaq.html'.

If you need to search the FAQ for a specific subject, look up that
subject in the two large indices at the end of the FAQ.  Inside Info,
pressing the `i' key will cause Info to prompt for a subject, and,
after you type the subject, display the first section that refers to
it; pressing the comma `,' key repeatedly will then display the rest
of the sections which discuss that subject.  If Info beeps after you
type the subject, it means there are no index entries which refer to
that subject; try a different subject.

For those who are familiar with the previous versions, the file
WHATSNEW.faq describes the changes in this release.

The HTML version of the FAQ was tested with Netscape (versions 3.01,
4.0, and 4.7) and with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.

Ready-to-print versions of the FAQ are available in the `faq230p.zip'
archive.  Currently, you will find there a PostScript version
`djgppfaq.ps' suitable for any PostScript device; a PCL version
`djgppfaq.lj' suitable for printing on LaserJet4 or better printer;
and a DVI file `djgppfaq.dvi' that can be used to drive any other
printer or device, provided that you find a DVI driver for that
printer or device.  Some DVI drivers ported to DJGPP can be found in
the v2apps/tex/ directory on the usual DJGPP sites.

If you want to create the FAQ list in other formats, or change its
Texinfo sources and regenerate the FAQ, get the file `faq230s.zip'
from the DJGPP archives and use the appropriate target of the Makefile
therein.  You will need the following programs to build the various
FAQ formats:

	- GCC and DJGPP C library
	- GNU Make (any version)
	- Makeinfo 4.0 or later (from the GNU Texinfo distribution)
	- TeX and DVI drivers from the Web2C distribution version 7.2
	  or later

Please note that you *must* use the LATEST upload of the GNU Texinfo
distribution ported to DJGPP, as previous versions had subtle bugs
that would prevent the FAQ from being correctly converted into some of
the supported formats, and also did not support conversion to HTML.
Beginning with version 2.30, the FAQ relies on Texinfo for generating
the HTML version; the previous kludgey way of using Texinfo macros and
auxiliary Sed scripts was tossed.

If you have comments, corrections or suggestions for inclusion
in the FAQ list, please mail them to <eliz@is.elta.co.il>.  Be
sure to include in your mail the version number of the document
to which your comments apply (you can find the version at the
beginning of the FAQ list).
