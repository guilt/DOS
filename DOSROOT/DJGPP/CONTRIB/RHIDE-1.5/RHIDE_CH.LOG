..........: I forgot to update this file, so here a summary:
            - Applied editor 0.3.5 => new desktop file format

            - Added disassembler window for debugging on assembler
              level. Not all is working correct but it is a first
              try.

            - Added the processor register to the disassembler window

            - Added ADA support (*.adb *.ads), but dependeny checking
              is not full implemented and also not the error checking

            - Added dual display support on linux, but only available
              when running as root or with setuid root!! (And of course
              only when a secondary monochrome display is available)

            - Enabled the keyboard selection in the help window under
              Linux.

            - Using now for the binaries newer GDB sources with some
              bug-fixes (it allows for instance now to debug programs
              on DJGPP which have mixed SDB and STABS debugging
              information). But RHIDE will still work and compile with
              official GDB 4.16 sources (I hope)

22.08.1997: Released version 1.3b

23.08.1997: For ADA, reading the dependencies now from the .ali files.

            RCS support in RHIDE also)

28.08.1997: Fixed the crash, when using Evaluate/Modify often enough
            (about 15 or 20) without starting a debug session before.
            (witdh and height was not set in gdbinter.c)

            special situations (autondent, optimal fill, tabsize 8)

03.10.1997: Fixed a strange bug which didn't close the file handles
            which were opened by open_ifpstream(). Will happen after
            each opening of a project- or desktop-file :-(

24.10.1997: Applied some changes from SET which brings some new code
            for screen font handling (but currently not used in RHIDE)

            CPU time when idle.

17.12.1997: In the breakpoints dialog:
              Enter -> jump to source

            Pierre Muller.

21.12.1997: Backslashes in "Main targetname" are converted now to slashes
            (the same for the "Primary file").

25.12.1997: Added support for FPK (or FPC??), the Free Pascal Compiler. Special
            source-file suffix for it is ".pp". Additionally it can be switched
            to use fpc as replacement for gpc (new switch in the preferences),
            where fpc is used then in all cases where there would be gpc used.

01.01.1998: When setting the "Main targetname" to empty, only the object
            files are created. This can be used, include in one project
            other so called subprojects.

02.01.1998: Applied many patches from SET about font, codepage things.
            Many changes and improvements in the keyboard system (but not
