This is a port of PDCurses 3.8 to MSDOS/DJGPP.



1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        The DJGPP specific implementation of PDC_napms using INT 0x2f function
        0x1680 and INT 0x28 does not work properly as soon as a programs like
        DOSIDLE.EXE are loaded.  Programs using PDC_napms seem to hang and it
        becomes necessary to hit some key to reactivate them.
        The DJGPP specific implementation now calls delay from libc instead.
        Apart from this change, only the Makefile for DJGPP has been modified
        to install the products according to the stock DJGPP installation tree.
        The diffs file shows the changes.  The library documentation is located
        in /contrib/PDCurses.38 and /share/doc/PDCurses.38.



2.:     Installing the library package.
        ===============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 pdcur38b.zip      or
          djtarx pdcur38b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d pdcur38b.zip



3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 pdcur38s.zip      or
          djtarx pdcur38s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d pdcur38s.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev205.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh204b.zip  (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip, shlNNNb.zip
          and txtNNNb.zip

        All this packages can be found in the v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.  NNN stands for the newest port versions
        available when this port was build but older may do the work as well
        but I have not tested this.

3.3.:   The sources are compiled in a separate build directory under the top
        srcdir (aka pdcurses-3.8).  To build the binaries cd into the
        "_build" directory and run the builf batch file like this:
          djbuild.bat
        It will set the required environment variables and build the library,
        the test programs and the manual using the DJGPP specific Makefile
        stored in the /dos directory.  This is Makefile.

3.4.:   Now you can run the tests if you like.  From the /_build directory run
        the command:
          testcurs

        There are some other example and/or test binaries.  You can run and
        inspect their code if you like.

3.5.:   To install the headers, libraries and docs run the following command
        from the /dos directory:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/place



        To send PDCurses specific bug reports look at
        <http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/> to see how to register to the bug
        mailing list.
        Send suggestions and bug reports concerning the DJGPP port
        to comp.os.msdos.djgpp or <djgpp@delorie.com>.


Enjoy.
