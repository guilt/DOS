- Use 'const' where appropriate on function arguments, e.g. strings,
  integers.

- When submitting diffs, please use either '-C3 -p' or '-u -p'. '-C3'
  generates a context diff with three lines of context; '-u' generates
  a unified diff; '-p' includes the function name in each section of
  the diff, which is useful when seeing what will change.

- Please follow the style of the existing code.

- Please write comments.

- Don't use tab to line up code. Tabs are evil, because every text editor
  seems to treat them differently. Use spaces instead.

- Use a style similar to the GNU style. Indent the line following a brace
  by two spaces. I recommend using GNU emacs's default C mode style for
  indentation.

- Use '*' to line up multi-line comments, e.g.

  /*
   * This
   * is
   * a
   * comment.
   */

- Put a CVS Id string in each file under CVS control, like the one near
  the start of this file.
