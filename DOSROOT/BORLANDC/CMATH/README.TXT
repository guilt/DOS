1. What is CMATH?
-----------------
CMATH is a comprehensive library for complex arithmetics and mathematics.
In the first place, CMATH is intended as a high-quality replacement for
the available C++ complex class libraries. In addition, all functions of
CMATH may be called from C, without the necessity to use C++.

Superior speed, accuracy and safety are achieved through the implementation
in Assembly language (as opposed to the C++ code of the common complex class
libraries).

Each of the three floating-point accuracies (float, double, and extended)
is given its own, optimized version of each function.


2. System requirements
----------------------
This version of CMATH is designed for IBM AT, PS/2 or compatibles,
equipped at least with a 80386 CPU and a 80387 coprocessor
(Visual C++ version: at least 486DX).

Depending on your choice when ordering or downloading, you need
- Borland C++ (Turbo C++), version 3.0 or higher, memory
  models Win32, Windows-LARGE, or  DOS-LARGE
- or Microsoft Visual C++, version 5.0 or higher, "single-thread debug"
  or "multi-thread debug"

Registered version for Borland C/C++:
all memory models; separate libraries optimized for all processors from
486DX/Pentium down to 286 with or without coprocessor.

Registered version for Microsoft Visual C++:
all PC models using the "single-thread", "multi-thread", or
"multi-thread DLL" run-time libraries, both for debug and release.


3. Installation
---------------
Please run the installation program INSTALL.EXE. 
If you don't like the directory structure created by INSTALL.EXE, you
can change it "by hand" after the completed installation to your liking.

After you completed the installation, you must set the library search path
and the include-file search path according to your CMATH directory choice.


4. Running the example
----------------------
Check your installation by compiling and running CDEMO.CPP. Follow the
instructions in the header of that file.
If you get compiler errors like "Cannot open include file ...", or a
linker error "Unresolved external", you probably did not set the library
and include paths correctly.


5. Documentation
----------------
The full CMATH documentation is to be found in the file CMATH.TXT as
ASCII text. If you want to load the documentation into a word processor
under Windows, you must use the filter "ASCII text" or "MS DOS text".

7. Registered Version
---------------------
If you like CMATH and decide to use it, please be fair and register.
The registered version of CMATH

-  supports all memory models of Windows95, NT, 3.x, and DOS of Borland C++,
   or all debug and release targets of Visual C++, respectively.

-  has individually optimized libraries for each degree of processor
   backward-compatibility (Borland C++ only):
      486DX/Pentium+
      386+ (387 coprocessor required)
      286+ (no coprocessor required).

-  comes with printed documentation.

-  entitles you to two years of free updates (by download from our web site).

-  costs USD 60 for the commercial edition,
         USD 39 for the educational edition,
