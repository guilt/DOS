This TELEFONE Program was written by me .It was not
made for harming anyone .So I am not responsible
for loss of any kind ,especially DATA .

Well ,the numbers in the menu might be self - explanatory ,
yet this is what they are for :


1 - To insert a new telephone number into your
    database ,for future reference .The maximum
    number of numbers you can store is 150 .
    
    Even if the number you enter is going to be a 
    dummy number ,the telephone number is being used 
    as a primary key ;So enter a dummy value
    that wasn't entered before by you .

2 - To edit a previous record .You have to type in 
    the old number to update that particular 
    record .

3 - To delete a previous record ,and remove it from 
    your database .Here again ,you have to type in
    the old number to delete that record .

4 - This is one of the most used options .Searches for
    a particular person's details by name or nickname .

5 - This is also an option .It allows one to
    search records by telephone number .

6 - This option is also considered to be a very useful
    one .It allows one to search for a person by
    email / street address / code / city / state 
    / country  .

7 - Search by all fields .Forces out dummy telephone numbers .
    Useful for updating / deleting records .

8 - View all of your records .

9 - Save currently added information and Quit .While
    doing this ,sorting of records based on name
    is performed .So the next time you use this program ,
    your records get stored in an orderly manner . 

TIPS :

1)
If you want to update / delete  a particular person's number
,but you don't know his number ,search by using the all field
search  ,note down the number carefully (one which is enclosed in []) ,
and then use it .This option forces out dummy numbers such as
"garbungy" .

2)
For saving all the data you have entered right now ,Use the quit 
option .Things like Ctrl-C might just work ,but you'll end
up losing information you might have entered just now .Also ,
only by quitting ,will your records be sorted properly by name .

3)
Enter a valid number in the main menu .Don't attempt to type words
etc. ,or your program will crash ,and you'll lose data typed now .

4)
To search ,use key parts of the word only .This makes search work faster .
To search for people who have a yahoo! e-mail ID ,typing "yah"
or "yahoo" usually does the trick .However ,searching for "y"
might give you more information than you need ,such as a person
living in hungar"y" ,or another in new "y"ork ,yet another in
lakshmanaswam"y" street ,or some more crap like that .

5)
Do not tamper with the TELEFONE.DAT ,as it is not usually editable by any Text-Editor .
(If you have Hex-Edit ,go ahead ,but I won't promise that your data will be safe and 
secure .)

6)
You'll notice that telephone numbers such as "garbungy" will be accepted ,
but they won't be printed while viewing .These can be used to your advantage ,
by just using as Dummy Keys .These dummy things can be printed by using 
search by all fields .

7)
Each field can only accept 40 characters maximum (which is enough for most
purposes .)So optimise whatever you write .If one can't help but have 
e-mail addresses such as "yetanothergeeknumbered1234@acrappedupdomain.com" ,
then I can't help you out ;Sorry .

8)
That's all .Don't be frightened to use a DOS Program .DOS Programs aren't that bad .
This one's pretty stable and easy to use .Of course ,you'll get better stuff in the 
Future .Till then ,I'll be seein' Ya .
