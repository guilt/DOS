<h1>Zip-Case-X File Protector SV</h1>

<p>This is the <strong>"Stable Version"</strong> of my File Protection programs
circa 2001.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Files encrypted in one Operating System are compatible with the others
too.</p>

<p>Ensure that the file names are in the <strong>DOS 8.3 format</strong>
(such as <code>.HTM</code>, <code>.MPG</code> ) for best compatibility.</p>

<p>The File to be Encrypted must ideally be in the current working
directory. Avoid usage of <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> or Directory separators
such as <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> in files, we don't try to interpret them.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>Go to the Appropriate Binary Executables Directory. Then Use:</p>

<p><code>
  encom File &lt;Encrypted File, Default is FPCODED.ZCX&gt;
</code></p>

<p>to encrypt your file, and</p>

<p><code>
  decom &lt;Encrypted File, Default is FPCODED.ZCX&gt;
</code></p>

<p>to restore your original file.</p>

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<p>This should not be used for any illegal purposes whatsoever.
Use your judgment.</p>

<p>Please see accompanying <code>LICENSE</code> for how this code is meant
to be used.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>When you use the most current version, files in the previous
versions won't work. So please retain the Older Version of
the Executables for Decrypting Purposes.</p>

<h2>Thank You and Feedback</h2>

<p>Reach out to me for any feedback.</p>

<p>Now Enjoy!</p>
