# DOS

This is my DOS development Environment. It contains
the binaries I need to work on.

## Instructions:

1. `git clone` this to a directory called `DOS` in your home
directory. 
2. Install *DOSBox 0.74* or higher.
3. Change the correct name in `DOSBOXRC` to where the `DOSROOT`
   directory is.
4. Edit the DOSBOX Config and change it to the contents of `DOSBOXRC`.
5. Launch DOSBOX
