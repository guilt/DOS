# DOS

This is my DOS development Environment. It contains
the binaries I need to work on.

## Instructions:

1. `git clone` this to a directory called `DOS` in your home
directory. 
2. Install *DOSBox >= 0.74* or *DOSBox-X >= 0.83.20*
3. Change the correct name in `DOSBOXRC` to where the `DOSROOT`
   directory is. Or change it in `DOSBOX-XRC` as appropriate.
4. Edit the DOSBOX/DOSBOX-X Config and change it to the contents the file you edited.
5. Launch!
